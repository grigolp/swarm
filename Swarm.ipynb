    "The problem can be visually represented as a collection of dots in space.  We receive the measured distances between all pairs of points. We should note, that the reconstructed system state (distances) from pairwise noisy data should be close to the true state.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider each pair's distance. Reconstructed distance should be almost equal to true distance. In this case, we can conclude the following: \n",
    "* If the noisy distance is less than the true distance, the reconstructed distance should be greater than the noisy. This means pair points should move away from each other.  <br />\n",
    "* In the opposite case, when the noisy distance is greater than the true distance, the reconstructed distance should be less than the noisy. This means pair points should move closer to each other.  <br />\n",
    "* And the final goal is that the points should be positioned to minimize the mean difference between true and reconstructed distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "This system is very similar to a mechanical system. We can draw an analogy. We place N points in the space and connect each pair through the springs:\n",
    "* Place stings for each pair we know the noisy distance.\n",
    "* The unstretched length of each spring should be equal to the noisy distance between the pair it connects. \n",
    "* Take the specific stiffness of the string as constant. In this case, the displacement (squeeze/stretch) of a long spring by constant value creates a smaller force than the same displacement for a short spring. \n",
    "Last step is advisable because the error of measuring long distances is always greater and it should contribute with less proportion than error on short distances. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the initial state, we can choose the random placement of points in the space and connect all pairs with springs.\n",
    "It is not necessary to place each point close to the true coordinates. Although placing points near true coordinates reduce solving time. \n",
    "\n",
    "From any (non-zero) initial point placements, the system will advance into equilibrium, where the net force to each point is zero.  \n",
    "If all distances in the matrix are accurate and there is no noise, then all springs in equilibrium are unstretched.  <br />\n",
    "In the case of noisy data, the springs in the equilibrium are stretched, although as we mentioned the sum of the forces acting on each point is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "For solving the problem we should take following steps: \n",
    "* Step 1. Initialize points in the space\n",
    "* Step 2. Calculate Forces acting to each point\n",
    "* Step 3. Update point coordinates using forces calculated in step 2\n",
    "* Step 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the system goes to equilibrium or the maximum number of iterations is reached\n",
    "\n",
    "By our definition equilibrium is achieved when the maximum net force on any point in the system becomes very small (less than $10^{-4}$). \n",
